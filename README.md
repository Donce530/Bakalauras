Project (apart from the flutter front end) can be run locally by using the included docker-compose.yml. Database credentials can be changed in database.env file before running docker-compose.

If you wish to see or change default user credentials, it can be done by editing the file ./Backend/Repository/Seed/AdminSeedExtension.cs
